# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

2. Task Creation and Management:
   - Allow users to create tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level.
   - Users should be able to assign tasks to other team members.
   - Implement a way to mark tasks as completed or in progress.
3. Task Filtering and Sorting:
